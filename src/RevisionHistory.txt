MutliaAlign Revision History
version 5.1.0 January 27, 2014
	- Updated user interface
	- Indexed database for larger and faster retrievals of data
	- Support for direct infusion IMS alignments
	- Weighted Euclidean metric for distance
	- New analysis options windows
	- Integrates MS/MS spectra with identifications
version 5.0.2 January 1, 2013
	- Added 64-bit support for raw files.
	- Removed any references to Thermo DLL's in the installer.  This package must be installed separately through Thermo's website.  See install page (omics.pnl.gov/software/MultiAlign.php) for more information.
	- Added edit file locations in the GUI so that you can remove or add raw files (or feature files) from the data selection window.
version 5.0.1  December 12, 2012
 	- Added new GUI
	- Added traceback capability
	- improved alignment performance 
	- improved caching performance for database
	- 32/64 bit support for both GUI and console
		- 64-bit does not support Thermo raw file reading yet.
	- removed MTDB database loading from Microsoft Access files
	- added capability to load MTDB databases in SQLite format from APE
version 4.1.1. November, 16, 2011
	- Added the ability to use a local MTDB for SQLite
	- Added factor loading using MAGE
	- Fixed space in the file name problem
	- Added STAC using drift time, same as VIPER
	- Added Saturated Member Count and Member Count columns to the output database.
Version 3.4.0 July 12, 2011
	- Added MTDB loading from access files for drift times.  Only works with x86 (32-bit) platforms because of limitations of Windows.
Version 2.7.4 December 1, 2010
	- Changed parameter file format to ini.  
	- Created a console version of the application that caches features between each analysis step to allow for larger analysis.
Version 2.7.3xx December 1, 2010
	- Added several plots on the analysis page showing cluster distributions, errors, and overall scatter plots.
	- Fixed the exception thrown when aligning to a MTDB via MTDB Creator saying a baseline is not set.
	- Fixed the legend displaying charge state N multiple times.
	- Fixed the protein name mapping problem
	- Added feature that if you double click on a protein name and match count, it’ll take you to that protein in the tree view to the left.
	- Fixed duplicate log files being generated (one in directory with analysis files, and another in the parent directory.)
	- Fixed a bug in the cluster charts (cluster scores vs. cluster sizes) that displayed cluster scores of 0 and 1 for datasets of size 8.
		- However, the abscissa is continuous showing cluster sizes of 1.2 and 1.5 etc.
	- Fixed a bug when aligning a single dataset to a MTDB. No matches were detected due to a clustering issue.
		- Made the cluster chart on the data view only show clusters (reduce memory overhead and clutter).
	- Each cluster is colored based on charge state.
	- Added scroll bar to analysis plots tab in the data view.  
	- Added feature that if no STAC calculation was performed then the histogram of scores in the analysis plot window would be displayed.
	- Added a date and time string to the log output.
	- Added a feature to try and load the ACE OLEDB provider, if it fails, then it’ll load the JET provider (i.e. loads the Access 2003 DLL).
Version 2.4. March 07, 2010
	- Added ability to read MS Access 2007 file formats.  Changed provider from JET OLEDB to ACE OLEDB. This may require you to have Access 2007.
	- Added SMART for LC-MS data.
	- Made cluster and peak matching options separate
	- Added ability to read UMC files from LCMSFeatureFinder or VIPER
	- Added drift time calculation additions for IMS data
	- Modified the peak matching algorithm to use drift time.
	- Added N out of M dataset filtering.
Version 1.1.2992.25141; March 09, 2008
	- Updated MultiAlign with the ability to read and align datasets to an access database.
	- Initial release version.
