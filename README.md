MultiAlign
==========

MultiAlign aligns multiple LC-MS datasets to one another after which LC-MS 
features can be matched to a database of peptides (typically an 
AMT tag database).  The program reads deisotoped features from either
DeconTools or ICR-2LS.  The LC-MS/MS Accurate Mass and Time Tag database 
is a SQLite file, typically generated by MTDB Creator.

The MultiAlign application provides advanced visualization and manipulation 
capabilities for LC-MS datasets acquired on high resolution mass 
spectrometers. Functionalities include overlaid 2D plots, alignment plots, 
normalizations, and basic statistical comparisons. MultiAlign uses the 
LCMSWARP algorithm to align LC-MS datasets to a master list (mass tag database 
or a single LC-MS dataset) and then consolidate features into a consensus map. 
These features can be matched to an AMT tag database to identify the LC-MS 
features. Data processing is similar to that performed with the VIPER 
application, but MultiAlign has the advantage of finding consensus features 
followed by matching to an AMT tag DB. The processing performed by MultiAlign 
results in fewer "missing values" vs. the results obtained when analyzing 
separate datasets with VIPER.
