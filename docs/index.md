Aligns multiple LC-MS datasets to one another after which LC-MS features can be matched to a database of peptides (typically an AMT tag database)

### Description
The MultiAlign program can read ICR2LS and [Decon2LS](https://pnnl-comp-mass-spec.github.io/DeconTools/) files and match the features found to an LC-MS/MS Accurate Mass and Time Tag database generated by the [APE](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/APE-DLL) application in SQLite format. If using MultiAlign inside PNNL, you can also load data from the Mass and Time tag System (MTS).

The MultiAlign application provides advanced visualization and manipulation capabilities for LC-MS datasets acquired on high resolution mass spectrometers. Functionalities include overlaid 2D plots, alignment plots, normalizations, and basic statistical comparisons. MultiAlign uses the LCMSWARP algorithm to align LC-MS datasets to a master list (mass tag database or a single LC-MS dataset) and then consolidate features into a consensus map. These features can be matched to an AMT tag database to identify the LC-MS features. Data processing is similar to that performed with the VIPER application, but MultiAlign has the advantage of finding consensus features followed by matching to an AMT tag DB. The processing performed by MultiAlign results in fewer "missing values" vs. the results obtained when analyzing separate datasets with VIPER.

This view shows all clusters found by MultiAlign, offers interactive plots, and the ability to drill from a cluster to raw spectra. Selecting a cluster in the data grid will display cluster details at the bottom of the screen.

##### 3rd Party Library Support

These installers do not supply the required DLL's to read Thermo Scientific Raw Files. You must download these DLL's separately and install them independently. You may do this after installing MultiAlign. They are available from the Thermo Scientific raw file reader library download page.
